                    <p class="card-text"><br><strong>Full stack development:</strong> It refers to the development of
                        both front end(client
                        side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong> Full stack web Developers: </strong>Full stack web developers have the ability to
                        design complete web
                        applications and websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web
                        applications or websites.
                        Technology related to full stack development:
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Front end:</strong>
                        It is the visible part of website or web application which is responsible for user experience.
                        The user directly interacts with the front end portion of the web application or website.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong> Front end Languages:</strong>
                        The front end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below:
                        HTML: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of
                        web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
                        Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text
                        documentation within tag which defines the structure of web pages.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
                        language intended
                        to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web
                        pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each
                        web page.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong> JavaScript</strong>: JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create the magic
                        on the sites to
                        make the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website
                        to running cool games and web-based software.<br><br><br>

                        <strong>Front End Frameworks and Libraries:
                            AngularJS</strong>: AngularJs is a JavaScript open source front-end framework that is mainly
                        used to develop single page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding
                        framework which provides better ways for developing web applications. It changes the static HTML
                        to dynamic HTML. It is an open source project which can be freely used and changed by anyone. It
                        extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is bound with HTML.
                        <br><br> <strong>React.js</strong>: React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript
                        library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end
                        library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.
                        Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites
                        and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing
                        responsive, mobile-first web sites.
                        <br><br><strong> SASS</strong>: It is the most reliable, mature and robust CSS extension
                        language. It is used to extend
                        the functionality of an existing CSS of a site including everything from variables, inheritance,
                        and nesting with ease.
                        <br><br>
                        Some other libraries and frameworks are: Semantic-UI, Foundation, Materialize, Backbone.js,

                        <strong>Back end:</strong>  It refers to the server-side development of web application or website with a primary
                        focus on how the website works. It is responsible for managing the database through queries and
                        APIs by client-side commands. This type of website mainly consists of three parts front end,
                        back end, and database.
                        <br><br>
                        The back end portion is built by using some libraries, frameworks, and languages which are
                        discussed below:
<br><br>
                       <strong>PHP:</strong>  PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since,
                        PHP code executed on server side so it is called server side scripting language.
                        C++ It is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive
                        programming. It is also used as backend language.
                        Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and platform. It is
                        highly scalable. Java components are easily available.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Python:</strong> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
                        efficiently.
                        <br><br>
                       <strong> JavaScript:</strong> Javascript can be used as both (front end and back end) programming languages.
                       <br><br>
                       <strong> Node.js:</strong> Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing
                        JavaScript code outside of a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework and
                        it’s not a programming language. Most of the people are confused and understand it’s a framework
                        or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like
                        Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix,
                        Walmart and so on.
                        <br><br><strong>Back End Frameworks:</strong>  The list of back end frameworks are: Express, Django, Rails, Laravel,
                        Spring etc.
                        <br><br>
                        The other back end program/scripting languages are: C#, Ruby, REST, GO etc.
