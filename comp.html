        <p class="fw-light lh-lg fs-5 mx-5"><strong> Did you know that there is an expected rise of 24% in software development
            jobs by 2025?</strong><br><br>With intensive research and technological development happening around the world, programming
            jobs are growing 50% faster than the overall job market. IT has gradually become one of the highest paying
            industries in the post tech-era.
            <br><br>

            According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), Computer Science graduates have the
            second-highest starting income. The average salary of a Computer Science graduate is ₹ 8 - 10 Lakhs per
            annum.
            <br><br>
            With exponential technological advancement, the demand for CS graduates has also seen a significant rise
            over the years. The companies hiring CS graduates range from Multinational Companies to start-ups.
            <br><br>
        </strong>The top 5 companies all CS graduates should aim to work in 2020 are:</strong>

            company of every engineering graduate, Google tops the Economic Times’ list for the most in-demand workplace
            in India.
            <br><br>
            Google follows a strict hiring process with two-types of interviews. The first interview is a telephonic
            round while the second one is an on-site interview. Both rounds last from about 30-45 minutes in which the
            interviewer checks your coding, case-based, leadership, and behavioural skills.
            <br><br>
            The average CTC you can expect as a Software Developer at Google is around 55-56 lac per annum.

            Amazon’s hiring process begins with an online assessment which is mainly a test of the applicant’s work
            style and leadership qualities. After clearing the assessment, you will have a phone interview. The phone
            interview will mainly test your behavioural as well as technical skills. Once you clear this, you will be
            called for the in-person interview at Amazon. Remember to complete your homework before the interview.

            Microsoft usually conducts four to five interview rounds. The process begins with a screening round which is
