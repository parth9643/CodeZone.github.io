        <p class="fw-light lh-lg fs-5 mx-5">With the internet boom and the exponential rise of various businesses in the
            form of start-ups; Data has become an inextricable part of business growth. Today, Data is King! Thus, terms
            like Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data have become the
            buzzwords of the 21stcentury technological world.
            <br><br>
            With the rising need to understand, examine, and use data; the demand for professionals who can work with
            the goldmine of data has also scaled. IBM predicted a sharp soar of 28% in the number of vacancies available
            for various Data Professionals.

            <strong>What is Data Science?</strong><br><br>
            Data Science is an interdisciplinary concept lying at the intersection of Mathematics, Economics,
            Statistics, Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. It includes data collecting, data cleansing, data
            analysis, data visualization, data prediction, and much more. With exponential digitalization, a humongous
            amount of data is being generated. But, data in itself is of no use; it becomes useful with Data Science
            which derives meaningful insights from data.
            <br><br>
            <strong> What is Artificial Intelligence?</strong><br><br>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the capacity that can be conferred to computers which empower these machines
            to get information, gain from the information, and settle on choices dependent on designs covered up in the
            information. In simple terms, AI is a branch of Computer Sciences that deals with the capability of teaching
            machines to learn and imitate human behaviors and patterns. AI is a type of neural network constructed on
            various algorithms designed to prepare machines in a way that assists humans in all their everyday jobs by
            learning human behavior.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong><br><br>
            Machine Learning is a sub-set or an implementation of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning refers to
            the practice of using various techniques and algorithms to extract data, analyze it, learn from it, and then
            forecast future trends for making better business decisions. Machine Learning has various algorithms like
            simple linear regression, decision tree regression, K-nearest neighbors, etc. which are used for
            clarification problems, clustering problems, etc.
            <br><br>
            <strong> What is Deep Learning?</strong><br><br>
            Deep Learning is an advancement of Machine Learning. It is based on various artificial neural networks. It
            is a function that processes data to mimic the human brain to enable machines in detecting objects,
            recognizing speeches, translating languages, and a lot more.
            <br><br>
            It is believed that Machine Learning comes in handy when the amount of data given is small, but Deep
            Learning is your one-stop solution while working on a huge amount of data with distinctive features.
            <br><br>
            It is also important to note that Deep Learning is more difficult to implement as compared to Machine
            Learning because it requires more training time and much more powerful hardware to work on.
            <br><br>
            Though we are far from times when machines would be able to imitate the human brain in all its complexity,
            Deep Learning is the bridge taking us closer to that future.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What is Big Data?</strong><br><br>
            As per Forbes, we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. The amount of data is so big that it creates
            manifold problems when it comes to storing, collecting, cleansing, analyzing, the data.
            <br><br>
            Big Data refers to an exponentially large amount of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Big
            Data is so large and complex that any traditional data management tool fails to secure it. Big Data is
            largely characterized by the three Vâ€™s i.e. the large Volume of data being created and stored, the large
            variety of data that is being stored in the data systems, & the Velocity at which the data is being created
            and stored in various data systems.
            <br><br>
            The larger role of Big Data is seen in improving operations, providing modified customer service, generating
            personalized marketing campaigns based on consumer preferences, and increasing profitability. In simpler
            terms, Big Data is revolutionizing a customer-centric market.
            <br><br>
            To conclude, Data Science is an interdisciplinary concept which aims to derive positive and actionable
            insights from data. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability to make machines learn and mimic human
            behavior. Machine Learning is a branch of AI that consists of processes and techniques to enable computers
            to use the data. Deep Learning is a further advancement of Machine Learning that enables computers to solve
            more complex problems.
